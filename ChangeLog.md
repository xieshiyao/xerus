 * Added a custom allocator to better handle the small allocations of Indices etc. (requires to set the corresponding option in the config.mk).
 * Reduced overhead (time not spent in blas) of TensorNetwork contractions.

 * Added several named constructors:
  * Tensor::ones(...) to construct tensors filled with all entries equal to 1.
  * Tensor::identity(...) to construct a (sparse) tensor equal to the TTOperator::identity.
  * Tensor::dirac(...) to construct a (sparse) tensor with a single 1 at a given position and 0 everywhere else.
  * Tensor::kronecker(...) to construct a tensor that is 1 when all indices are equal and 0 otherwise.
 * ! misc::approx_equal now uses a relative difference (for consistency with the tensor variant xerus::approx_equal).
